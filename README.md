# Introduction:

Udacity DAND: Communicate Data Findings Project.

First,this dataset is from  Dataset Options that Udacity was given.


This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, for 2008.


The data consisted of 7,009,728 flights(row) and 29 columns.
we analysis the dataset and change data type for many columns that we need, and replace numbers to appropriate days or months. 


for data visualization, we start by asking ourself quations, it about relationship between variables and rate of variables.




## Summary of Findings

we got many points:
    - canceled flight by security is very low.
    - the rate of flight in month was in July.
    - the rate of cancel rate is very low.
    - depature delay influence on arrival delay.
    - canceled flight is very high in crowded seasons.
    - the average of departure delay in days by months increase in seasons.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- cancel rate of flight is very low.
- depature delay influence on arrival delay.
- Distribution of Departure Delay is right skew.
- months can effect on cancel flight.
